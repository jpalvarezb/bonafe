# AgroPeq — Competitive Positioning

*Synthesis of [codebase-dossier.md](codebase-dossier.md) (multi-agent code analysis, 84 adversarially verified claims) and [market-landscape.md](market-landscape.md) (deep web research, 75 verified claims). July 2026.*

## 1. The niche

AgroPeq is a **Spanish-first whole-farm ERP for smallholder-to-mid-size (10–50 ha) Central American farms and cooperatives with day-labor/piecework crews and unreliable rural connectivity**. This is not an aspiration — it is encoded in the product: seed data models a Matagalpa (Nicaragua) coffee operation with lata harvest units, Broca/Roya pest tracking, $8–12/day jornaleros and NIO/USD dual currency; regional labor vocabulary (planilla, destajo, jornal, cortero) exists as TypeScript enums, not translated copy; pricing is three flat self-serve tiers (Semilla $100 / Cultivo $200 / Cosecha $350 per month) far below enterprise agri-ERP.

The market research confirms this niche is **open**: Central America barely registers in every regional agtech census (Radar AgTech LAC 2026: Brazil 78% of 2,656 startups, no CA country in the top tier; Brixton 2023: AR+MX+CL+CO = 80% of LatAm agtech). The incumbent layer in-region is coffee-only institutional apps (ICAFE, ANACAFE, IHCAFE), exporter-scoped ERPs (Hispatec, COPERAWEB), and — for most farms — WhatsApp, Excel, and paper.

## 2. The one-line competitive claim

**No competitor bundles piecework payroll + per-cycle harvest→processing→sales profitability + multi-warehouse weighted-average inventory + offline-first field capture in one Spanish-first SMB product.** Every rival fails at least one axis:

| Closest competitor | Has | Missing vs AgroPeq |
|---|---|---|
| **Aragro** (Guatemala) — the direct head-to-head | Piecework, multi-warehouse, processing+sales, budgets; free→$100→$350/mo (same price points) | **No offline mode at all** (cloud-only); Guatemala-only |
| **Huella / COPERAWEB** (GT/CA) | Offline capture, warehouse depth, traceability | Coffee/exporter-scoped; no payroll, no multi-crop farm management |
| **Hispatec ERPagro** (CR office, all 7 CA countries) | Full accounting + field payroll | Enterprise-priced, sales-led, exporter tier — not SMB |
| **FieldClock / PickTrace / Datamine CULTIVA** | Best-in-class piecework capture | Point solutions; payroll outsourced or MX-tax-bound; no farm suite or profitability |
| **Auravant / Instacrops / Kilimo** (LatAm) | Spanish, regional brand, precision-ag | No payroll/inventory/profitability; no CA presence |
| **Agworld / Granular / Croptracker** (global) | Feature breadth | English-first, priced for large commercial farms, no CA localization |
| **farmOS / LiteFarm / WhatsApp+Excel** | Free | No payroll, no costing; self-hosting beyond most smallholders |

## 3. Differentiation that survived adversarial verification

- **Offline exactly-once sync is real and rare.** The code has an idempotent outbox (UUIDv7 keys, single-flight flush, crash recovery) with per-mutation-kind conflict handling and a row-locked, monotone work-order merge — while the market is full of *claimed* offline that is naive sync (Aegro's "100% offline" refuted; documented duplicate-submission and sync-failure problems in KoboToolbox/ArcGIS Field Maps). Caveat: "works offline" is a checkbox everyone claims — the marketable claim is **reliability** (never lose or duplicate a field record).
- **DB-enforced multi-tenancy** (fail-closed Postgres RLS on ~40 tables + NOBYPASSRLS role + CI coverage guard) — strongest engineering moat, hard to retrofit.
- **Purpose-built day-laborer payroll** (attendance fractions, piece rates, frozen rate snapshots, period locks) vs US/EU salaried assumptions.
- **Domain-native localization** — regional units and labor concepts as enum values, not JSON copy; an English-first competitor cannot cheaply bolt this on.
- **Decimal-precise money math** unit-tested across payroll/inventory/profitability/variance.
- **DB-level crop-cycle overlap guard** permitting intercropping (btree_gist EXCLUDE) — generic tools have nothing comparable.

## 4. Gaps and risks (code-verified)

The two biggest market white spaces are **exactly the half-wired parts of the codebase**:

1. **Piecework is not attributed to crop cycles** (`pieceworkEntries` has no `crop_cycle_id`; activity labor cost path is an admitted stub). The market's #1 gap — destajo labor wired through to per-cycle margin — is currently a claim, not a fact. Same for **WAC inventory**: real weighted-average valuation exists but activity input costs are manually re-typed, so P&L can silently diverge from inventory value.
2. **Profitability is cycle-average, not lot-level COGS**; sales-to-cycle is an unvalidated manual tag.

Other verified risks:
- **Zero e2e/integration tests** — nothing exercises RLS boundaries, sync, or Stripe webhooks at runtime; sales/purchases/transfers have no tests at all. Material diligence risk.
- **No notifications of any kind** (invite email is a `console.log` stub) and **no API/webhook surface** — no path to accountants, banks, or certification systems.
- **Export lock-in**: no export of harvests, sales, payroll, or inventory. For a trust-sensitive SMB market, data-out is table stakes.
- **Stripe USD-only vs cash/Tigo Money reality** — self-serve billing is a differentiator (most rivals hide pricing) *and* an adoption barrier in rural CA; FX is manual with no rate feed.
- **Offline covers only 5 of ~24 modules**, conflict resolution is discard-only.
- **No agronomic intelligence** (no GDD, pest-trend, spray advisories) — fine, but don't market decision support.

## 5. Strategic moves

1. **Close the money loop first.** Add `crop_cycle_id` to piecework, wire WAC costs into activity costing, and link harvest lot → processing → sale. This converts the market's biggest unfilled gap from marketing claim to verified fact — nobody else has it.
2. **Attack Aragro head-on with offline reliability.** Identical price points, near-identical bundle, but Aragro is cloud-only. "Your planilla and harvest weights survive a dead signal — exactly once" is the wedge in Guatemala/Nicaragua/Honduras.
3. **Ship accountant-grade CSV export (payroll, sales, harvests, inventory) before any API.** Cheap, kills the lock-in objection, and matches how CA accountants actually work.
4. **Hedge payment rails**: keep Stripe self-serve (transparency is rare in this market) but add manual invoicing/mobile-money paths for orgs without cards.
5. **Do not chase** precision-ag/satellite intelligence (Auravant/Instacrops own it), enterprise exporter ERP (Hispatec), or single-crop traceability (Huella/COPERAWEB/FARMS Digital). Stay the **multi-crop SMB operating system**; a lightweight WhatsApp/email digest is a better notification investment than a native alerting engine.
6. **Before selling up-market or raising**: add an e2e test suite over RLS isolation, offline sync, and the Stripe state machine — the engineering is strong but currently unproven at the integration level.
